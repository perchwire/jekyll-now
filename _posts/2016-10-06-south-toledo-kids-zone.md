The South Toledo Kids Zone is modeled after **The Harlem Children's Zone.** <sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

The Zone's purpose is to create a **Cradle to Career** pipeline.

The South Toledo Kids Zone encompasses 6,600 households from the High Level Bridge to the Toledo Zoo and between the Anthony Wayne Trail [Route 25] and the Maumee River.

This area is the most diverse neighborhood in Toledo, but unfortunately, 45 percent of the residents live below the poverty line, and 39 percent did not graduate high school.

Baby U wants to break the cycle of poverty by ensuring kids are ready to learn when they begin school.
