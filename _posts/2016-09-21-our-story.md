David and Kelly Kaiser and a group of amazing young people were called to Western Avenue Baptist Church, allowing Former Pastor Don Bethan and his wife, Betty, to retire. 

The Bethans had been faithfully serving the community for twenty years providing love, care, groceries and meals to this impoverished neighborhood in South Toledo. 

With God’s guidance, the new team has forged ahead with this mission of meeting the community’s spiritual and physical needs.

Recognizing that by the time they begin formal schooling, children in low-income families already lag significantly behind middle class peers academically, socially and physically, Western Avenue Ministries established Baby University, the first step in developing a cradle to career pipeline for South Toledo. 

“Baby U” began in partnership with Cherry Street Mission funded by a generous grant from the ProMedica Advocacy Fund of the Toledo Community Foundation.


Western Avenue Ministries moved around the corner to 1411 Broadway Street.
