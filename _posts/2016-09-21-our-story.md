David and Kelly Kaiser and a group of amazing young people were called to Western Avenue Baptist Church, allowing Former Pastor Don Bethan and his wife, Betty, to retire. 

The Bethans had been faithfully serving the community for twenty years providing love, care, groceries and meals to this impoverished neighborhood in South Toledo. 

With God’s guidance, the new team has forged ahead with this mission of meeting the community’s spiritual and physical needs.
