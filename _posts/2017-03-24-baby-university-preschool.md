According to the Toledo Public School system, children growing up in Toledo's Old South End are starting Kindergarten 75% behind their middle class peers. 

The Zero to Three Foundation states that early education or high-quality preschool have helped close this gap, which leads to an increase in high school graduation rates, a decrease in special education rates, a decrease in  incarceration rates, and an increase in employment rates, later in life. 

Once a family is connected to Baby University, our vision is to provide the best educational options for them in an effort to break the cycle of generational poverty in South Toledo. 

We believe that a high quality education is a way out of poverty. That is why we chose the best possible preschool partner to serve our families. 

**Toledo Day Nursery** is one of the nations oldest and best Preschool Providers. Their accreditation is in the top 7% of the nation. Their long term mission and commitment to providing high quality, affordable preschool to those who need it the most makes them an excellent partner for the South Toledo Kids Zone pipeline.
