At Baby University, a Parent Advocate is someone who pleads the cause of another. 

Each Baby U parent is assigned their own Parent Advocate. PAâ€™s meet with them via home visits, connecting them to important community resources, and answering any parenting questions they may have. 

100% of our graduates have been connected to some kind of community resource after attending Baby U, including grocery assistance, clothing assistance, safe housing, and connection to health and mental health resources. 

Lori Patton West has been working as a Parent Advocate for  years. 

Margie Ocampo is another Parent Advocate.
