## Questions or Needed Info:



##### volunteer page

- <http://babyutoledo.com/21/volunteer>
  - should *"outside instructor"* be added as a volunteer type? **[jan 17, 2017 update: yes, the section was added.]**


##### our story page

- <http://babyutoledo.com/15/our-story>
  - more info needed after 2010.


##### mosaic ministries page

- <http://babyutoledo.com/164/mosaic-ministries-of-south-toledo>
  - should this baby u page be removed from the baby u website?
  - what about the link at the bottom of each page that points to the mosaic ministries page? **[jan 17, 2017 update: yes, keep the page and link]**


##### parent advocate or social worker?

- in multiple web pages, the phrase *"parent advocate"* was changed to *"social worker"* except in the drop-down menus under "volunteer".
- <http://babyutoledo.com/21/volunteer#Do-you-like-to-listen>
  - at baby u classes, is this volunteer person a parent advocate, a social worker, or something else?
  - should parent advocate remain in the other pages because it "sounds better" than social worker? **[per jan 17, 2017 meeting, changes were made]**


##### united way donation

- in the united way section of the donation page, more details are needed about the process of donating through the uw to baby u.
  - <http://babyutoledo.com/8/donate#United-Way>
- do we need more info about the algorithm that the united way uses to decrease the amount donated? 
  - uw claims that a certain percentage of people donate less than they committed, therefore uw created an algorithm that automatically adjusts the amount given to the other org. 
  - apparently, uw distributes the money to the receiving org before the actual money is received from the donor. this makes sense that uw would create an algorithm, since it could lose money if it distributed the committed amount, and  it received less money committed by the donor. 
  - but what about the people who actually donate what they committed? it appears that not all of the donors' money is going to the org that was earmarked to receive the money.
