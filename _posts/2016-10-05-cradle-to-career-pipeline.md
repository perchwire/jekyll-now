To help South Toledo families prepare their pre-school children for an education, Baby University created the South Toledo Kids Zone.<sup>1</sup> The Zone's purpose is to create a long-term "Cradle to Career" pipeline with the ultimate goal of ending generational poverty.

### Pipeline for Parents

Baby University also offers a “pipeline” of sorts for parents in the form of our [Graduate Classes](/baby-university-graduate-class). 

Parents can enroll in classes that help them build family resources, financial literacy, and job skills that will help them move from being welfare dependent to self sufficient.
