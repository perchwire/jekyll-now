*Sep 2016* - I'm building this test website by using Jekyll with GitHub pages, but I'm not using a local install of Jekyll, which requires committing web posts.

I'm using GitHub's web browser editor to create and update pages.

I created a new GitHub account with username perchwire.

I followed instructions at <https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now> and I forked that repository. Then I changed the name to perchwire.github.io. The repository is helpful for getting started with using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

The author of the above repository also created this helpful  smashingmagazine.com article titled [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages).

In addition to using GitHub's web browser editor to maintain content, I'm testing Development Seed's editor called [Prose](http://prose.io), which is designed to work with GitHub Pages by connecting to a GitHub account. It's pretty slick. Well done.

When any file is saved within my GitHub Pages repository (perchwire.github.io), GitHub automatically rebuilds the site, or it rebuilds the changed page.


### Baby University Webstie

I built <http://babyutoledo.com> using my Grebe web publishing app. I can create Grebe posts by using Textile, Markdown/MultiMarkdown, and HTML. The content is stored in a MySQL database, but I cache content in memecached.

Since I've recently taken a liking to the concept of static HTML-based websites, I want to try to recreate much of the Baby U website at perchwire.com, using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. 

I think that search is the only function that requires content to be dynamically-generated for browsing-only users. The blog section at Baby U is dynamically-generated. The vast majority of the site, however, could be served via static HTML pages.

The customized version of Grebe that I use at Baby U permits using different page templates on a per-post basis. That should be easily replicable with Jekyll.

I have already recreated the Adopt a Family page.

* Perchwire.com + Jekyll + GitHub Pages : [Adopt a Family](http://www.perchwire.com/adopt-a-family/)
* BabyUToledo.com + Grebe : [Adopt a Family](http://babyutoledo.com/4/adopt-a-family)

To-dos as of Sep 17, 2016:

* recreate the look for the default Baby U pages
* recreate the Baby U homepage
* recreate the look of the Baby U blog 
* add any other custom pages, CSS, and JavaScript, such as the CSS used to display the thermometer on the donor page(s)
