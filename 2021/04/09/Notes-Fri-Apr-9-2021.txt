## Another day in P-burg

I walked Barney in the 8am for 28 minutes. We did not walk yesterday. During my walk this morning, I heard the songs of a Ruby-crowned Kinglet and a Brown Thrasher.

Late yesterday afternoon, I noticed that the redbud trees, located along the Tiff Ditch stream at Woodmont were showing reddish-purple redbud buds. I confirmed it this morning while walking Barney.

This is shocking. The redbud flowers have not opened yet, but normally, I see redbud buds/blooms in the first and second weeks of May. The plants are at least three weeks ahead of schedule now.

Numerous tree and shrub varieties are blooming now. The forsythia is blooming well still, but the shrubs are showing green on the tops. Magnolia or tulip trees are starting to bloom. Many trees with white flowers are blooming.

I spent all day yesterday in Perrysburg because work was being done on the basement of our new house. A lot of of jackhammering and pounding. They are working on the basemenet again today, and I'm here in Perrysburg all day again.

I'm setup in what will be Janet's bedroom on the ground floor at the north side of the house, overlooking the backyard. It's a nice room. I have had windows up in this room booth days. Yesterday, I thought that I heard the callnote of a Winter Wren in the backyard.

Yesterday was warm again with a thundershower and moderate to heavy rain for a brief period in the afternoon.

Today has been sunny and pleasant. Temps in the 60s to around 70 by Noon. Sky has been clear all day until around Noon with some clouds now at 12:39 p.m. We might get another thundershower or storm later today.

I got my second Covid-19 Pfizer shot at the rec center at Noon on Wednesday. I felt good yesterday, and today I feel normal. I felt a little snoozy in the late morning yesterday, then I felt normal yesterday afternoon. I felt snoozy again after eating dinner yesterday evening. I went to bed early, but I did not go to sleep. I sat up and read and watched TV. Then I was not tired. I felt normal. I finally went to sleep around 1am.

I got the second shot in my left deltoid again. This time, my deltoid was not as sore as after the first shot, which was not much soreness. It felt like I had lifted something heavy and the muscle was sore after the first shot. That lasted a day or so. But little to no soreness this time.

Yesterday morning, my temp was 97-something. Last evening, my temp was 98.2 and 98.3. The thermometer still read green. I had no aches and no chills. My pulse was only slightly elevated yesterday.
